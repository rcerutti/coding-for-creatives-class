	My name is Ryan Cerutti and I am currently attending Miami Ad School as an Art Direction student.</br>
Originating from San Diego, California, I decided to leave the sun and sand and trade it in for concrete</br> 
and seasons. Now living in New York City for 3 years I have taken another leap of faith and joined Miami </br>
Ad School to pursue a career in advertising after spending so many other years of my life working jobs </br>
that I never liked, causing me to resign many after only a year or two, leaving a trail of 16 to 20 </br>
different jobs in my wake. 
</p>
<p>
When looking toward my future I had no choice but to look at the past and see what, if anything, those </br>
jobs had in common which would lead me into my next step that could be permanent and sustaining for myself </br>
and my family. During those formative years there was only one constant in my life and that was my creative </br>
side. No matter the income, schedule, or mental tax any of my jobs took on me; I seemed to have always had </br>
the motivation to create. Collaborating with friends to make short films, build web sites, film web series, </br>
draw comic strips and books, and write blogs. I found there was no end to what medium I wanted to put my </br>
creative stamp onto. Even though I found time to create, I never thought I could make a living doing any of </br>
the things I enjoyed so I fell out of touch with the innovation and pushed more into what I felt was logical </br>
for me to sustain a living. 
</p>
<p>
After living here in the city for a while I began to question what it was I was doing here exactly to </br>
which I began to realize the opportunity that New York has to offer and how I was squandering my time here.</br> 
So I decided to reverse engineer what I wanted to do. I searched the internet for jobs that were creative which </br>
led me to read about an Art Director position. Wondering how that was an actual job, I looked to see what I </br>
needed to do educationally to achieve this job title. I kept seeing Miami Ad School pop up. I got my information,</br>
sat in on a class and fell in love with what was being talked about and saw there were people just like me all </br>
over the place who I could connect to that shared my same passion and thought process. 
</p>
<p>
After that, I enrolled. 
</p>
I hope with this new path I will be able to sustain a full future of creativity and would like to be the best </br>
I can possibly be in my new positions to come. I want to use my experiences to give me the edge over others </br>
where I can stand out as an award winner and a person others can rely on and trust. I would like to eventually </br>
become a creative director and oversee many projects and ideas from concept to reality. That is what I have </br>
enjoyed doing in the past with my free time, I just can't believe I will get the chance to do it for a living.</br>
